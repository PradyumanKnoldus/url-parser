# URL Parser
## Session 4 Day 2 Assignment 1

Created a URL parser using the concept of Extractors (unapply method) with pattern matching that takes the input (URL) as string and displays 

        Protocol
        Domain 
        Path 
        
from the given URL.

The URLParser class is a simple utility for extracting the protocol, domain, and path components of a URL string. It provides an apply method for creating a new instance of URLParser with the specified protocol, domain, and path, and an unapply method for extracting the protocol, domain, and path from a given URL string.
